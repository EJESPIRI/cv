        <p>My name is Eric Justine, a recent graduate from UC Irvine with a B.S. in Biological Sciences and a minor in Informatics. During my days of studying the human mind and body in college, I realized who we are and how we are can be attributed a lot to design. As human beings, we’re a product of intricately designed proteins that contribute to how we look and how we function. Similarly, technology, social media, and software applications are all a result of designed components coming together that have a huge influence in how we behave and interact with others. Ultimately, design plays a big role in our daily lives. It is for this reason and my passion for shaping how the world will be in the future using the Internet and technology that led to my interest in the UI/UX field. </p></td>
